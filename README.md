# UNIMUS
UNIMUS is a  tool for online enumeration of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of a given unsatisfiable Boolean CNF formula in the dimacs format. The tool implements several MUS enumeration algorithms including UNIMUS (called same as the tool), MARCO [9], TOME [2], and ReMUS [3]. 

We distribute this source code under the MIT licence. See ./LICENSE for mode details.

## Installation
Before building UNIMUS, you have to first get the zlib library and cadical. As for cadical, follow the instructions at https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical to create the library libcadical.a, and then copy libcadical.a to the folder with UNIMUS. To install zlib, use the following:
```
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
```

To build UNIMUS, run in the main directory (the one where is this README.md file):
```
make
```

## Running our tool
in the main directory, run "./unimus _file_" where _file_ is an input file of constraints. You can use one of our examples, e.g.:
```
./unimus examples/test.cnf
./unimus examples/bf1355-228.cnf
```
To run the tool with a time limit (always recommended), use e.g.:
```
timeout 20 ./unimus examples/bf1355-228.cnf
```
To save the identified MUSes into a file, run:
```
timeout 10 ./unimus -o output_file examples/test.cnf
```
To see all the available parameters, run:
```
./unimus -h
```

## Other Third-Party Tools
Besides mniSAT, we also use two single MUS extraction algorithms: muser2 [5] and mcsmus [8]. You do not have to install these. Muser2 is presented in our repo in a binary form, and mcsmus is compiled with our code. 

## Related Tools
The tool UNIMUS originates from our another MUS numeration tool called MUST (https://github.com/jar-ben/mustool). Contrary to UNIMUS, MUST is a domain agnostic tool which means that it can be used in various constraint domains such as SAT, SMT, or LTL. If you want to enumerate MUSes in the SAT domain, we recommend to use UNIMUS. If you are interested in other domain than SAT, use MUST.
